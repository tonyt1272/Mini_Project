# Mini_Project

"""Movie ratings are extremely subjective. A movie rated as excellent by one user
may be rated poorly by the next. Can movie ratings be made more useful, or even
normalized by understanding the relationship between the user and the movie
being rated?
For example: If it is known that some user is a frequent viewer of Action movies,
should we expect that user to rate an Action movie higher (on average) than other
movies? If so, it may be useful to identify whether a rater is a frequent viewer of a
genre when considering his/her rating for a given movie.
This project explores the relationship between how a viewer’s ratings
are influenced by the genre of the movie being rated relative to the viewer’s own
viewing habits."""
